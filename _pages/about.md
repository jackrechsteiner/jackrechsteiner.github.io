I am a PhD student in the Linguistics program at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Dr. Villarreal](https://www.linguistics.pitt.edu/people/dan-villarreal). My research focuses primarily on sociophonetic variation in nonbinary speakers. I'm passionate about understanding the inner workings of language and the interplay between language and society, as well as how insights into these topics can be applied to other areas. Sociolinguistics, data analysis, and identity construction in discourse are especially interesting to me.
